# load-sample-set

Loads a set of samples as buffer instruments using `promises`:

I found this package 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/sample-loader

but I had some problems making it work in a browser. 

This loader also uses the same format. 

## install

npm install --save load-sample-set

Or use the `dist` script

## Usage:
